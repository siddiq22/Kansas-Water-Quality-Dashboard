## ðŸ’§ Kansas Water Quality Analysis & Dashboard
### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Kansas water quality using data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) and other socio-economic datasets. The goal is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps users explore water quality trends, visualize socio-economic factors, and understand regional variations in water conditions.

The analysis focuses on:

Visualizing water quality metrics across Kansas counties.

Exploring socio-economic correlations, including income levels and water quality.

Identifying trends in water characteristics (e.g., pH, phosphorus, nitrogen levels).

Providing an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for analysis and decision-making.

### ðŸ“‚ Data Source
The dataset combines:

Water Quality Portal (WQP) â€“ Provides water quality data collected by the USGS & EPA.

IRS Tax Statistics (2021) â€“ Used for socio-economic insights.

### ðŸ“Š Data & Methodology

Dataset Features: Water quality characteristics, collection sites, income levels, geographic attributes.

Data Cleaning:

Filtered Kansas-specific water quality data (2018-2023).

Merged IRS income data at the county level.

Removed missing values (173,140 records analyzed).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified water quality trends & socio-economic disparities.

Mapped high/low-income counties & their water characteristics.

Analyzed correlations between income & water quality.

### Visualizations Included

âœ” Choropleth Map (Income by County)

âœ” Choropleth Map (Water Quality by County)

âœ” Scatter Plot (Income vs. Water Quality Correlation)

âœ” Trend Analysis (2018-2023 Water Quality Data)

### ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Excel

Data Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Interactive Dashboard: Power BI

### ðŸ“¢ Key Findings

Higher-income counties tend to have better water quality, but data gaps exist.

Some counties lack sufficient water quality data, making analysis difficult.

Correlation between income & water quality varies by region, with some counties showing strong relationships.

Filtering water quality data to 50 key characteristics helped focus the analysis.

### ðŸ“Œ Future Work

ðŸ”¹ Expand the dataset with historical water quality trends.

ðŸ”¹ Use machine learning models to predict water contamination risks.

ðŸ”¹ Integrate more socio-economic variables (e.g., population density, land use).
